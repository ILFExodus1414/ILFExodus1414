# 👋 Hello! I'm Imelda Forteza

**Ecologist | Microbial Genomics Explorer | Science Storyteller**  
Curious about the hidden lives of microbes, blue carbon, GHGs — from forest floors to mangroves.

---

🧬 **About Me**  
I’m an ecologist with a passion for uncovering how microbial communities shape ecosystems — from velvet worm guts, shipworms, and forest spiders (huntsman and funnel webs) in decomposing logs, to mangrove sediments, oceans, and restored wetlands.

My work blends microbial genomics, ecological fieldwork, and cross-ecosystem carbon research. I’ve trained and mentored students, managed labs, and contributed to interdisciplinary projects in US, Australia and the Philippines.

I am currenly working on a manuscript on the gut microbiota of velvet worms (*Euperipatoides rowelli*) across Australian deadwood microhabitats — stay tuned!
